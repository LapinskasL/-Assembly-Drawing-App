# -Assembly-Drawing-App

This is a drawing application I created using x86 assembly language. It it uses the Irvine32 library.

There are many issues with this app, such as: no indication when the eraser tool is selected, a lot of code executing redundantly, etc. However, this was not to create anything perfect, but to practice coding, following logic, organizing code. In general, I wanted to use what I learned from my assembly course and just see what I can make.

It was very fun.
